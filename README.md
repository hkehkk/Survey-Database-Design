# Survey-Database-Design

For this project I designed a database suited for the Farm Survey Web project (see other repositories). I chose to do a NoSQL database as I am less familiar with them, but I know how great of a resource they can be. 
This project was a great way to use what I have learned in previous programming classes. I created the database to store data when inputted through the Farm Survey Web design. In my project, I included functions to allow for storing and receiving information directly to/from the database. This is very helpful in testing the database connections and to make sure the data is being stored properly.  I chose to select this database design as it works well with the information needing stored. 
I have continued to gain knowledge on these database types through working on such projects. I have not worked on a database that is very similar to the other. Because of this I am prepared to work with different needed databases to ensure the quality for the client. I have found there is less available knowledge about working with NoSQL database, therefor I relied mostly on my learnings from class and class materials.
I ultimately gain more experience with each project I create. This project required me to be a problem solver as I struggled with getting the right information entered for the database connection string. I find that is one thing a programmer must be, a problem solver, with any application.
